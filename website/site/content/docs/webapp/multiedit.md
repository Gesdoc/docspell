## Toggle Selection Mode

Docspell allows to edit and delete multiple items. Search the items
you want to edit or delete and then select them by changing into
"select mode". This changes the view slightly by adding a menu to the
main area and the item cards contain a check box:

Then select items by clicking on the card. You can also change the
search form and add more items to the selection. The top left shows
how many items are selected and allows to select and deselect all
visible items. Selected items are displayed in a different color.

## Choose an Action: Edit

Once all desired items are selected, choose an action. Currently you
can edit or delete them. When clicking "edit", the left side menu
changes to a form for changing the metadata:

Changing the metadata in that form immediately applies it to all
selected items. You can change the selection anytime.

If you are done, just click on the icon from the beginning to go back
to "normal" mode.

## Choose an Action: Delete

When choosing the delete action, a confirmation dialog shows up. If
you confirm the deletion, then all selected items are deleted at the
server and the view is switched back to normal mode afterwards. Note
that deleting a lot of items may take a while to finish.
